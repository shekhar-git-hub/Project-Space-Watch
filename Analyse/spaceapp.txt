Sustaining Our Planet For Future Generations

Sustainability involves the developments of economical, societal and environmental aspects without compromising our planet's resources so that future generations can meet theri needs.Sustainability involves taking action now to enable a future where the environment and living conditions are protected and enhanced. To this end, NASA seeks to use public funds efficiently and effectively, promote the health of the planet, and operate in a way that benefits the neighbors. NASA has been on the path to achieve long-term sustainability goals for many years through numerous efforts in energy conservation, recycling, water management, pollution prevention, design and construction, maintenance and operations, master planning, and electronic stewardship.

Earth observation (EO) data inform our daily lives, providing critical information to help in our understanding of the interconnectedness of people, the planet, and prosperity. EO data are used in tracking biodiversity, assessing the impact of disasters, managing natural resources, observing land use changes, and mitigating climate change. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO), of which NASA is a partner, has developed a coordinated and consistent set of observations that can be used in assessing several of the SDGs.
